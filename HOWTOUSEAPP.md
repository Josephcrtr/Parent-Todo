Getting started with parent-child task appüçÄ
 

 //DESCRIPTIONüìã
this app consists of a todo-appüìã, a notes appüìú and a camera appüì∏.
All of these components which you can use to effectively assign tasks to your children or anybody in particularüë•.


//HOW TO USE THE APPüìã
    TODO
    --you can set todos for yourself or someone,
    the app then generates a link to the generated todo
    which you then share to the persn you're assigning
    those tasks to.

    NOTES
    --you can attach notes to add extra description about a certain 
    or all todos e.g time for a task to be executed, names of stores,
    extra info and all other long text you can't  add on a todo listüëÄ


    CAMERA/PHOTOS
    --you can also take pictures of items and stuff using the camera
    appüì∏,also you can record video memos for talking,
    explaining tasks which are too long to type in the notes app,this is effective because the receipient can replay the video anytime if he/she doesn't understand a task or forgets what to do about a certain task.

    THIS PIECE OF SOFTWARE ISN'T ONLY LIMITED TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN
    ONLY. ORGANISATIONS CAN USE IT TO SET TASKS FOR WORKERS AND ATTACH NOTES OR VIDEO MEMOS WHICH CAN BE VERY USEFUL,POINT IS... ANYBODY CAN USE IT BECAUSE WITHOUT HAVING TASKS OR GOALS IN LIFE,LIFE WOULDN'T BE ALL THAT NICE WOULD IT?.. 



    HOW IS THIS ANY EFFECTIVE?

    --when you share  todo link to anybody, the person has no access to your panel i.e
    the page where you originally created the todo, so he/she can't delete or add tasks.
    plus, there's a button on the receipient's end where he/she clicks when a task is completed.
    this highlights the completed task in a different color to show it has been completed and the reciepient
    take pictures of the completed task with the camera appüì∏ and send to you,ALL THESE FEATURES ON ONE SOFTWARE!!!

    if you haven't signed up, you won't be able to see if a person as completed a task..









    BIG CATCH!!!

    IF YOU HAVEN'T SIGNED UP, YOU CAN ONLY SET TODOS AND SHARE LINK TO TASK, YOU CAN'T ATTACH NOTES AND ATTACH VIDEOS.

    IF THE RECEIPIENT HASN'T ALSO SIGNED UP, HE/SHE CAN'T OPEN SHARED LINKS BEACUSE SOME PRIVATE TASKS OR NOTES AND VIDEOS COULD BE THERE, YOU DON'T WANT A RANDOM PERSON VIEWING THOSE DO YOU?
